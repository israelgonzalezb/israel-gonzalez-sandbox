3. On your [Dashboard](https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/), click **â‰¡ Menu -> Applications**.
4. From the [Applications](https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications-legacy) page, copy the ```key``` and ```secret``` credentials and set them as the environment variables ```DWOLLA_KEY``` and ```DWOLLA_SECRET```.

#### Install
`yarn install`

#### Run server
`yarn start`

The server runs on port 3000 by default. Change that by setting the PORT environment variable.

On first visit to `/`, the server will create 20 fake customers. To manually run the user creation script, visit `/create`. The server then redirects you to the index page.
